## Goal/Objective
The goal of this project is to build an interactive food ordering system for a customer using Python. The program allows users to select menu items from different categories, specify quantities, finalize their order, and receive a receipt with total. The system ensures seamless processing to ensure that the program handles varied responses.

## Problem/Question
The challenge is to create a program that can handle dynamic menu selections, validate user input, and provide an engaging interface for placing food orders. The project also aims to ensure proper error handling, allowing for continuous orders until the user decides to stop.

## Key Features
- Users can choose from multiple menu categories (Snacks, Meals, Drinks, Dessert).
- The program checks if the user's input is valid and prompts them for corrections if needed.
- The program calculates the total cost of the order based on the quantity and item prices.
- The program creates a receipt for the user overviewing the entire order of items, their prices, and the grand total.
- A `match-case` statement is used to handle user responses to continue or stop ordering.

## Unique Observations
During the development of this Python script, special attention was paid to handling input flexibility (such as allowing lowercase and uppercase responses) and ensuring users are prompted if valid input isn't received.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to my local machine.
2. Run the Python script (e.g., `python-challenge-1`).
3. Then follow the on-screen prompts to place an order.

## Conclusion
This project successfully creates an interactive and user-friendly food ordering system. The use of `match-case` and input validation ensures a smooth user experience, making it easy to handle multiple orders and deal with any input errors.
